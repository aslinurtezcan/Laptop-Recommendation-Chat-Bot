# Laptop-Recommendation-Chat-Bot
This project uses a neural network to recommend laptops based on user preferences. Users input their desired laptop specifications (brand, type, screen size, resolution, CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, OS, weight, and price), and the chat-bot suggests suitable options from a dataset. Developed in Python, it leverages Pandas for data processing, Scikit-learn for data splitting and scaling, and TensorFlow/Keras for the LSTM model. To use, clone the repository, install dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and run `src/main.py`. The dataset should be placed in the `data` directory as `laptop_data.csv`.
